# SaveTitan

SaveTitan is a python script that allows you to backup your PC saved games to a local drive or netork storage location that provides a game syncing experience between devices similar to services integrated into Steam, Xbox, and other platforms. It also has some additional features that I felt like adding such as, an ini/json config modification tool to simplifly the process of locating files, editing, backing up, searching, in an all in one tool thing.

THIS IS CURRENTLY A VERY EARLY UNSTABLE BUILD AND IS NOT REGARDED SAFE AROUND YOUR FILES SO MAKE SURE TO BACK UP EVERYTHING YOU POINT THIS TO. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK


## Installation

Details coming soon as I get closer to release
